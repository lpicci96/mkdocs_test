# Why bblocks?

In many data teams—especially in the international development 
sector—analysts and researchers often find themselves repeatedly 
solving the same types of problems: harmonizing country names, 
cleaning messy data, fetching datasets from public sources, or 
building workflows that transform and validate data for analysis 
and reporting.

Too often, these solutions live in personal scripts, scattered 
notebooks, or ad hoc utilities that are hard to maintain, share,
or standardize across projects and teams.

We built bblocks to centralize these recurring tools into a well-structured, reusable, 
and tested collection of packages. Packaging these tools ensures:

__Consistency__: Everyone on the team uses the same reliable methods and conventions.

__Efficiency__: Analysts can spend less time reinventing the wheel and more time focusing on actual insights 
and storytelling.

__Maintainability__: Improvements and bug fixes are applied in one place and immediately benefit all users and 
projects.

__Scalability__: The tools can support both small-scale, quick analyses and production-ready pipelines 
that power dashboards and data portals.
By modularizing these utilities, bblocks turns fragile, one-off code into solid, reusable components
that grow with your data ecosystem.

## Who Is bblocks For?

bblocks is designed for:

__Data Analysts & Researchers__: Especially those working with international development datasets who need fast, reliable tools for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.

__Data Engineers__: Who want to integrate standardized tools into larger ETL workflows, ensuring consistency and validation across pipelines.

__Policy & Advocacy__ Teams: Needing quick access to harmonized, high-quality data to support policy briefs, advocacy campaigns, and public reports.

__Development Organizations & NGOs__: Seeking to strengthen data workflows, avoid duplication of effort, and ensure high standards of data quality and reproducibility.
It is especially useful for:

Handling country and region concordance (e.g., mapping non-standard country names to ISO codes and assigning them to income groups or regions).
Building and maintaining ETL pipelines that feed into Data Commons or other structured data repositories.
Working with open datasets from global institutions, where formatting and validation are crucial for accuracy.
In short, if your work involves international development data and you’re tired of repetitive tasks or ad hoc solutions, bblocks offers a toolkit to make your work more robust, maintainable, and efficient.
