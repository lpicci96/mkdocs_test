# ODA Basics

ODA is packed with technical jargon and concepts. Here, we break down some of these terms to make navigating foreign assistance a bit less overwhelming.

## What is ODA?

ODA stands for Official Development Assistance—resources like money, goods, and services aimed at supporting low-income countries. These funds can help build infrastructure, promote public health, or respond to humanitarian crises.

The Development Assistant committee ( DAC) is a group of high-income countries which oversees how ODA is managed and monitored within the OECD. While DAC members are the main contributors to ODA, non-DAC countries, multilateral organizations, and private institutions play a role in providing ODA as well.

The DAC also determines which countries qualify to receive ODA and which international organizations can report ODA contributions. More on this here.

## Key concepts

Understanding ODA requires grasping some key distinctions:

### Bilateral vs multilateral ODA

Bilateral aid flows directly from donor governments to recipient countries, while multilateral aid is channeled through international agencies that manage and allocate the funds. The key difference? who controls the money. Bilateral aid means the donor country calls the shots, even if a multilateral organization helps deliver it. Multilateral aid, on the other hand, leaves the decision-making to the international agencies.

Sometimes we want to track multilateral aid from a donor to a recipient. Since these funds are pooled and redistributed by multilateral organisations, they can’t be directly traced. Instead, we estimate imputed multilateral flows based on the share each donor contributes to multilateral organisations and how those organisations allocate aid to recipients.

### Grants vs loans
ODA can be given as grants, which don’t need to be repaid, or as loans, which must be repaid with interest—though at a lower rate than regular loans.

### Flows vs grant equivalents
Traditionally, ODA was measured in total flows, or the full value of grants and loans provided. Since 2018, the official way to report ODA became a loan's grant equivalent, meaning more favorable loan terms lead to higher ODA values. More on this here.

### Commitments vs disbursements
Commitments reflect donor intentions, while disbursements show actual ODA payments, offering a clearer picture of aid received.
