# ODA Data

ODA data gets updated twice a year. In April, we get the big pictureâ€”total ODA by donor countries for the previous year. By December, the details roll in: where the money went, broken down by recipient country, sector, region, and income group. Plus, partial updates in June and September.

The OECD publishes ODA data across numerous tables, which makes it tricky to find the information you need.

At ONE, we get most of our ODA data from:

DAC1, which offers a broad overview of aid as reported by donors.
DAC2A, a useful table for tracking flows of ODA from donors to recipients.
CRS, which provides detailed project-level data of bilateral aid flows.
MultiSystem, which contains detailed project-level data of multilateral aid flows.
